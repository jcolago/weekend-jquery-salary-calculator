# PROJECT NAME
Salary Calculator

## Description

This is my first weekend project for Emerging Digital Academy.

This application takes in employee data and calculates the total monthly cost based on the employee's annual salary. 

Employee data is entered into the input fields and displayed on the page when the submit button is clicked. The total monthly cost is then calculated when an employee is added or removed from the list. The background of the total monthly cost will also change to red if the cost is over $20,000.

## Usage
1. Enter your employee's Fist name, Last name, ID Number, Title, and Annual Salary into the appropriate fields.
2. Click 'SUBMIT' to calculate that employee's monthly cost.
3. Employee data will be displayed in the employee table.
4. To remove an employee, click "DELETE" in the employee row. This will also update the total monthly cost.

Total monthly cost will update with each added or removed employee.
